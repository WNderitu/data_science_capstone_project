# Plasmodium Vivax (malaria) parasite detector and counter

## Introduction

## Problem Statement

## Project Objectives

1. To detect Plasmodium Vivax (malaria parasite) in human cells
2. To count the number of detected plasmodium vivax parasites per image

## Methods Used

## Technologies

## Project Description

The project will entail conduct of the following:

## Image Dataset

Images obtained from Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection webiste <https://bbbc.broadinstitute.org/BBBC041/>

The dataset consists of:
- image folder
- training json file
- test json file

The dataset consists of 1,328 microscopic images of blood smears. 

The various categories to be detected are 7.
- Red Blood Cell (uninfected)
- Trophozoite
- Schizont
- Difficult
- Ring
- Leukocyte (uninfected)
- Gametocyte

The Red Blood Cell and Leukocyte categories are blood cells that are not infected with the malaria parasite.

The Trophozoite, Schizont, Ring and Gametocyte are different growth stages of the malaria parasite

The difficult category is a growth stage that couldn't be grouped into either of the 4 growth categories.

## Image Pre-processing and Feature engineering
 - Data cleaning, which invloves checking for duplicate images, 

## Machine learning Modelling

## Recommendations/Next Steps

## Folder structure

The folder contains the following files:
